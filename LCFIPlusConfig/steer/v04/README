For the IDR samples produced in 2018, it is required to rerun vertexing
to recover the performance. 
This directory includes some example steering files for analyses with such IDR samples.

1) revertexing.xml
This example can be used for revertexing on samples that have a PFO collection.
Set input SLCIO files, GEAR file and output SLCIO file name.
Note that the Vertex collection names have "_NewVtx" suffixes in this example.
This is because we can not modify the existing vertex collections.
Use these new vertex collections at the other parts in your steering files.

2) jetclusteringAndFlavourtagging_2/4/6Jets_NewVtx.xml
This example can be used for jet clustering and flavour tagging on samples
that have vertex collections created above ("_NewVtx").
Set input SLCIO files, GEAR file.
In addition, MVA weight files, prefix, and vtxprob files must be set, which can be
found in LCFIPlusConfig/lcfiweights and LCFIPlusConfig/vtxprob.
Note that the weight files in 6q500_v04_p00_ildl5 and 6q500_v04_p00_ilds5 were prepared
with 6b/6c/6q, 500GeV, w/ beam background samples. 
Therefore jetclusteringAndFlavourtagging_2/4Jets_NewVtx.xml may not be optimal for
2/4 jet event analyses.
