This directory includes some example steering files for analyses with the 250GeV samples produced in 2020....

1) jetclusteringAndFlavourtagging_2/4Jets.xml
This example can be used for jet clustering and flavour tagging.
Set input SLCIO files.
In addition, MVA weight files, prefix, and vtxprob files must be set, which can be
found in LCFIPlusConfig/lcfiweights and LCFIPlusConfig/vtxprob.

Note that the weight files in 2q250_vvH_v04_p00_ildl5, 2q250_vvH_gg_v04_p00_ildl5 were prepared
with vvH followed by H to bb/cc/qq/gg at 250GeV, w/ beam background, 
and 4q250_ZZ_v04_p00_ildl5 was prepared with ZZ followed by ZZ to 4b/4c/4q at 250GeV, w/ beam background.

(Update 20210721)
Weight file created with 2f processes at 250GeV added: lcfiweights/2q250_v04_p00_ildl5/*, vtxprob/d[z]0probv2_ildl5_2q250.root
