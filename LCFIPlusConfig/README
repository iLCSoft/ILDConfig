 LCFIPlusConfig/
 ---------------
    input files for flavor tagging

    steer
    -----
    example steering files

    vtxprob
    -------
    input histograms used for flavor tagging
    used as input to the following parameters in the steering file:
      <parameter name="FlavorTag.D0ProbFileName" type="string" value="vtxprob/d0probv2_ildo1v5_qq91.root"/>
      <parameter name="FlavorTag.Z0ProbFileName" type="string" value="vtxprob/z0probv2_ildo1v5_qq91.root"/>
    for new joint probability variables (d0probr2 etc, included in v3 weight files), d0/z0probv2 needed.
    d0/z0probv2 files are backward-compatible with v1/v2 weight files.

    lcfiweights
    -----------
    TMVA weight files

    To use the weight files, first unpack it using e.g.
      tar zxvf 6q500_v02.tar.gz
    By default the files will be expanded into the same directory.

    Use the XML files from the steer/ directory corresponding
    to the weight files: v0X and p0X numbers should match.

    The following steering parameters control which weight files get used.
      <parameter name="FlavorTag.WeightsDirectory" type="string" value="lcfiweights" />
      <parameter name="FlavorTag.WeightsPrefix" type="string" value="6q500_v02" />

    Currently available weight files are the following:

      qq91_v01:    e+e- --> qq at 91.2 GeV, generated by Whizard, no ISR, no beam profiles
     *qq91_v02:    e+e- --> qq at 91.2 GeV, same as above, with more variables.
                   The v02 steering files must be used to use these weight files.
      qq91_v03:    e+e- --> qq at 91.2 GeV, same as above, with updated joint probability.
                   The v03 steering files must be used to use these weight files.
      (All samples below are generated by Whizard and DBD beam parameters and pythia tuning.)
      qq250_v01:   e+e- --> qq at 250 GeV.
      6q500_v01:   e+e- --> 6-jet samples at 500 GeV.
     *6q500_v02:   e+e- --> 6-jet samples at 500 GeV, same as above, with more variables.
                   The v02 steering files must be used to use these weight files.
      6q1000_v01:  e+e- --> 6-jet samples at 1 TeV.
     *6q1000_v02:  e+e- --> 6-jet samples at 1 TeV, with additional variables.
                   The v02 steering files must be used to use these weight files.

      (All samples below are generated by Whizard and IDR beam parameters and pythia tuning.)
     **6q500_v04:  e+e- --> 6-jet samples at 500 GeV, same as qq91_v03, with more variables.
                   p00 is prepared for the IDR MC samples produced in 2018, in which the primary
                   and secondary vertexing had some issues on IP smearing and thus you are required to
                   rerun vertexing. Dedicated README in steer/v04.

    **recommended for analysis (ilcsoft-v02-00-02, February 2019)

      PLEASE NOTE: v01 weight files are deprecated as they have a problem in c-tagging performance.
      This is fixed in v02 which incorporates additional variables.
      See talk by T.Suehara at LCWS12 for some description of the v02 variables.

      The _p0X suffix refers to the different preselection cuts applied to the tracks.
      It is found that their impact on b-tagging performance is small.

      *_p00 files are created with the following cuts:
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinTpcHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinFtdHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVxdHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVtxFtdHits" type="int" value="0" />

      *_p01 files are created with the following cuts:
      (This is the configuration used in DBD mass production as of v01-16)
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinTpcHits" type="int" value="20" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinFtdHits" type="int" value="3" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVxdHits" type="int" value="3" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVtxFtdHits" type="int" value="1" />

      *_p02 files are created with the following cuts:
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinTpcHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinFtdHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVxdHits" type="int" value="10000" />
      <parameter name="BuildUpVertex.TrackMinVtxFtdHits" type="int" value="1" />
